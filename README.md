If you use [slidedown](http://github.com/nakajima/slidedown) and you want your slides in PDF, this is for you:

<pre><code>macruby to_pdf.rb --number 27 http://nmerouze.github.com/blockcampparis09
macruby to_pdf.rb -n 27 http://nmerouze.github.com/blockcampparis09 myfilename.pdf</code></pre>

**NOTE**: If your last slide is #26, you have 27 slides (because there's a slide #0).


Unsure of what license nmerouze wanted to release this as..
but afaik, it's (C) 2009 Nicolas MÃ©rouze
with parts (C) 2009 Michael Bernstein

I'll release my minor changes under whatever license he meant to, so he can edit this if he takes my patch :P.
